## Description
Pair Up is a cooperative 3d puzzle game that challenges two players to work together as a team to solve different puzzles and progress through the game. 
Each player controls a unique character with special abilities, and their progression in the game depends on their ability to communicate, collaborate, and combine their characterâ€™s skills.
The ultimate goal is to ascend through a series of platforms, each representative of a level. 
The players discover a new platform every time they solve the puzzle for the platform they are currently on. 
The higher the players go, the more complex the puzzles become, and the more they have to rely on each other to progress.
