extends Resource
class_name SoundEffect 

## Sound effect resource, used to configure unique sound effects for use with the AudioManager. Passed to [method AudioManager.create_2d_audio_at_location()] and [method AudioManager.create_audio()] to play sound effects.

## Stores the different types of sounds effects available to be played to distinguish them from another. Each new SoundEffect resource created should add to this enum, to allow them to be easily instantiated via [method AudioManager.create_2d_audio_at_location()] and [method AudioManager.create_audio()].

## Checkes whether the audio limit is reached. Returns true if the [member audio_count] is less than the [member limit].

	return audio_count < limit


## Connected to the [member sound_effect]'s finished signal to decrement the [member audio_count].
